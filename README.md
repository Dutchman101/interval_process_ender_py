# interval_process_ender_py
This tool allows you to automatically end a certain process (on Windows PC's) repeatedly within a specific, user-defined interval.

It's a very niche use tool, imagine a scenario like this: some program/process has a memory leak, and the vendor doesn't fix it in a timely manner.. so you'd rather restart it silently ever now and then before it builds up a huge memory usage. This tool is a result of my personal need for this, when dwm.exe was leaking memory on a Windows Insider preview build (causing regular crashes of games) and I couldn't rollback, so it saved my life. Who knows it can still help others in various scenario's, so i will publish it after all.
